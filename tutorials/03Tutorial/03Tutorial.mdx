I'm learning that creating good notes, is an essential aspect of learning in public.

Your notes communicate understanding for yourself and to other learners. Those notes can take different forms, from code snippets, blog posts, or cheatsheets.

In this case, after finishing [Cameron's](https://twitter.com/ccnokes) course [Automate Daily Development Tasks with Bash](https://egghead.io/courses/automate-daily-development-tasks-with-bash). I decided to create a well designed cheatsheet.
