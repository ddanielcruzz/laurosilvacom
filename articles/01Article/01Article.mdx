I want to teach you how a **setup a modern, productive, and fun** development workflow.It can be overwhelming setting up the perfect development workflow. Sometimes you just want to jump right into the code.

So, here's my approach.

### Code Editor

```

Having a light, simple code editor is ideal, but in this case, having an **in-browser code** editor is better. That's why we will be setting up **[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)**.

With CodeSandbox you don't have to set up a development environment, install dependencies, or worry about tooling.

You just jump right into the code. For now, sing up for a CodeSandbox account.

## Setup

We're also going to need a place to host our web application, and **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** is the perfect place to host it.

Start by signing up for a Netlify account, if you don't already have one. Now, Netlify can connect to any Git repository hosted at GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and auto-publish every time you push a commit.

In this case, we are going to use Github to host our repository and link it to our Netlify account. Let's sign up for a **[Github](https://github.com)** account if you don't already have one.

# The Workflow

Now that we have our CodeSandbox, Netlify, Github accounts it's time to set up our workflow.

### CodeSandbox

Open CodeSandbox and select a public template. In this case, we are going to select the **Gatsby template**.Now that we have our Gatsby template opened, we need to fork it. This will create a copy to our CodeSandbox account.

### Github

We will also proceed to connect our Github account.

Once we've connected our account we need to export our template to our account.You can see now, inside of Github we have the repository of our Gatsby template.

### Netlify

We will take this repository and deploy it to Netlify, by clicking on _Select a new site from Git_.

We proceed to **connect our Github account to Netlify**. This will give us access to our repositories.

We select our repository and click deploy with the default settings. It takes a couple of seconds, but once deployed you will see your site live.

You can also set up a domain name directly using Netlify. Feel free to check out other cool features that Netlify provides. For now, let's stick to our development workflow.

### Automatic Deployment

Netlify automatically starts a new deployment process every time we push a new chance to our Github repository. So let's do that from CodeSandbox!

Let's fork once again our CodeSandbox. And let's make some changes to our code and let's select the Deployment icon. Let's commit our changes by adding a subject and a message and clicking the commit or pull request button. Now automatically the changes will be pushed from CodeSandbox to Github. And from Github to Netlify.

Congratulations! üéâ

You've just set up a productive, simple, and fun development workflow. All without install dependencies, or worrying about setting having the correct local development environment.

## Summary

We learn how to set up a modern, productive and fun development workflow. Making it easier for us to focus on coding and learning from the start.I hope you found this tutorial useful. Until next time.

Stay awesome! üòÅ
