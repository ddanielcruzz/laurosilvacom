Sometimes you don't want to merge two branches, but simply your desire is to apply the same changes in a commit on top to another branch. This situation is very common when working on bugs: you fix a bug in a branch, and then you want to apply the same fix on top of another branch.

Git has a convenient way to do it; this is the git cherry-pick command.

Let's play with it a little bit.

Assume you want to pick the blackberry from the berries branch, and then apply it into the master branch; this is the way:

```bash
[1] ~/grocery (master)
$ git cherry-pick ef6c382
error: could not apply ef6c382... Add a blackberry
hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'
```

For the argument, you usually specify the hash of the commit you want to pick; in this case, as that commit is referenced even by the berries branch label, doing a git cherry-pick berries would have been the same.
